# HW1-code-refactor

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to take code and refactor it in order to learn how to refactor code and what to look for when doing so. 

Main Objectives: 

- Implement semantic elements where usable 
- Edit and consolidated CSS to simplify it and eliminate any redundancy
- Reorder code in a logical manner in line with the flow of the code
- Add alt tags to images and icons to increase accessibility

Additional tasks included adding comments to the code to describe any alterations made to the code or CSS, making sure the deployed application was functional and operated and looked like the example code, add/commit/pushing to Git and providing links to both the deployed application and GitHub repo.
